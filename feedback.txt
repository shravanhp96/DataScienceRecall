You project is very interesting, I like the proposal, it seems to address everything we asked for.

You are planning on generating a word cloud, in my opinion word cloud is not the best visualization technique if you want to compare recall reasons in terms of frequency, a ranked table or a simple bar chart would be better at showing these trends. However word cloud can look good if there are few reasons which occur much more frequently than others. 

I encourage you to implement multiple techniques, compare and comment on them if needed in your project.

- Question that arose: are we sampling enough? i.e. 2010-2014 a suitable timeframe, or would more years be necessary?
- Possibly continue decision tree instead of word cloud 
- Consider other country regulations. Right now only FDA regulations are considered
- Categorizing recall reasons
-- Scrape through phrases of recall reasons
--Maybe also look at trade names, those might be more explicitly defined
- Data visualization
--consider a global heatmap to better map which companies have the most recalls, on a globe or map
-Predictive recall number
-- account for confounding variables, try to predictive which companies (maybe focus only on the big companies) will have the most recalls and how many recalls in the next five years.
